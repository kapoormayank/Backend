1).   <html>
Starts the HTML document. All HTML content should be inside this root element.

2).   <head>
The head section contains metadata about the page (title, styles, meta tags, links to scripts/CSS).

3).   <title> Hello World </title>
The <title> element sets the page title shown in the browser tab. Here it will display Hello World.

4).   </head>
Closes the head section.

5).   <body>
Begins the body of the HTML document — the visible content delivered to the browser.

6).   Hello World ! <br/>
Plain HTML text "Hello World !" shown on the page followed by <br/>, an HTML line break (moves subsequent content to a new line).

7).   <h2 style="text-align: center;">
Starts an <h2> heading element and sets an inline CSS style to center its contents horizontally.

8).   <%
Opens a JSP scriptlet. Anything between <% and %> is Java code that the JSP engine executes on the server when the page is requested. The scriptlet runs while the JSP is translated into and executed as a servlet.

9).   out.println("My First JSP Page!");
Java statement inside the scriptlet:
out is an implicit JSP object (a JspWriter) made available automatically by the JSP container. It writes content to the HTTP response stream (the HTML sent to the browser).

println("My First JSP Page!") writes the string My First JSP Page! followed by a newline into the response at that point in the page.
So this line prints that text into the page inside the <h2> element.

10).   %>
Closes the JSP scriptlet.

11).   </h2>
Closes the <h2> heading element. The text produced by the scriptlet appears inside this heading and will be centered (because of the style).

12).   </body>
Closes the body element.

13).   </html>
Closes the HTML document.


-> Meaning of text-align

text-align is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) property used to control the horizontal alignment of text (and inline content) inside an HTML element.

-> In HTML (and JSP, which generates HTML), they are used to define headings:
Tag	Purpose	Visual Size
<h1>	Main heading (largest)	Biggest
<h2>	Sub-heading of <h1>	Smaller
<h3>	Sub-heading of <h2>	Even smaller
...	...	...
<h6>	Smallest heading	Smallest


-> Where <li> is used

The <li> tag must be used inside either:

<ul> — unordered list (bulleted)

<ol> — ordered list (numbered)

---->   Use Cases of <li>:

Navigation menus
Steps in a process
Displaying looped data (e.g., in JSP or JavaScript)
To-do lists or checklists

-> The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration in HTML is very important—it tells the browser what version of HTML you're using, so the browser knows how to interpret and render your web page.

->  JSP Rule to Remember:
Task	Use This
Write Java code	<% ... %>
Print a Java value	<%= ... %>
Write HTML	Outside any <% ... %> blocks

-> Tag	Purpose
<strong>	Makes text bold and semantically important
<b>	        Makes text bold only visually
</strong>	Closes the <strong> tag

-> <table></table>

<table> — Starts the Table
It tells the browser: "Hey, I’m starting a table here."
Everything related to the table must be inside this tag.

-> <tr></tr>

<tr> — Table Row (Horizontal Line of Cells)
Stands for "table row"
It wraps one full row of data in the table.
For each value of i (like 1 to 20), you usually create one row.

-> <td></td>

<td> — Table Data (Each Cell/Represents one cell of data (column))
Stands for "table data"
It represents a single cell inside a row (<tr>).
Inside the <td>, you can display any data —
